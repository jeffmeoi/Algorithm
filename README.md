# Solutions
After my past Olympiad in Informatics **(totally forget)** and college entrance examination, I start to prepare for my posibly future ACM-ICPC experience. In the beginning, all the problems come from 《算法竞赛入门经典（第二版）》（刘汝佳） and 《算法竞赛入门经典训练指南》（刘汝佳）. All the solutions will follow the auther by me and be explained by Chinese. Besides, I will keep to update my solutions in Github. However, because the Internet, I haven't submit the programs to UVa OJ to run so that I can't sure whether the program is exactly correct.

Listed below is the content.
