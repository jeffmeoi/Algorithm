# Solutions
After my past Olympiad in Informatics **(totally forget)** and college entrance examination, I start to prepare for my posibly future ACM-ICPC experience. 

I code the programs with the codes of the auther. I try to explain all the programs so clearly that you can comprehend more easily than the book.

All the solutions are explained by Chinese. Besides, I will keep to update my solutions in Github. 

Listed below is the content.
